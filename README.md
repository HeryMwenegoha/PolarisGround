Copyright (C) 2017 Hery A Mwenegoha.

Works with PolarisAir.

## Setup
Tested on VS2017 and VS2015.

## Work
1. Some bug fixes 
  1.1. splash screen load up issues
  1.2. packet loss over small distances (rfd900 radios)
  1.3. Optimise logger
2. Optimisation...

Still a long way from having a fully functioning ground control station and flight control sytsem, let me know if you would like to help.
